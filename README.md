# TrafficWarning
A Python script to warn you on your upcoming travel times.

This script is to be used in conjunction with TextOnComplete (see https://github.com/huksu/TextOnComplete).

The concept is as follows:

I work about 15 miles from where I teach, but my class begins during rush hour.  The routes (there are multiple) are hit or miss.  They can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes.  The wild variation requires me to constantly monitor the traffic situation lest I should be late for lecture.

I have this script running on my work computer to warn me of potential travel issues.  Starting at about two hours before class starts, I send 15 minute updates on the current traffic situation.  Think of it like an advanced alarm clock.  If the traffic is horrendous, I can check out early and make it to lecture on time.
